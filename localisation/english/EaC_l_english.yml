 EMPIRE_DESIGN_yldarian_raider_clan_desc:0 "The Yldari origins are unknown, but oral traditions explain they where genetically designed as a warrior caste from a precurser empire of old. With their old masters long dead, the Yldari clans have been united and are looking outward to reap new spoils from undefended worlds. The Yldari are an all male species and cannot reproduce normally, relying on Ancient Cloning Vats to propagate their species. However, this has the boon of making them the perfect warrior in battle. This created a culture of pride, believing menial tasks should be left to slaves."
