The rest of the [FROM.GetName] collapsed quickly after, and their remaining fleets have disbanded. While many of the surviving captains will return to less organized piracy, others have announced plans to honor minor mercenary contracts, offering logistical support or space station garrisoning. But such trifling affairs are of little consequence. The important fact is that the Pirate Enclave is no more, and from its wreckage we have been able to salvage a sizable amount of resources."

 EaC_civic_mechanic_events.245.desc:0 "The Khan's ships present an overall well rounded composition, with no clear weakness. Our smugglers suggest that torpedoes might perform well to take their ships down, but caution against specialized defense. A mix of both shields and armor is probably your best bet to keep your ships alive. The Khan has proven to be an extremely competent commander and underestimating them would be a terrible mistake. Consider their retinue as an extreme menace."
 EaC_civic_mechanic_events.250.desc:0 "The Gray Tempest relies on two complementary weapon types: energy beams and strike craft. The former is countered by shields, but shields are bypassed by their strike craft. Our projections show that ships fitted with point defense in addition to shields have a much better chance to survive the engagement. Nanite ships are extremely well protected, but torpedoes might help in breaching their defenses."
 EaC_civic_mechanic_events.255.desc:0 "Prethoryn fleets rely on slow moving projectiles and hosts of smaller ships to take down their foes. One option to fend them off is to use point defense, coupled with armor and improvements to your ship's hull resilience; another is to engage them at extreme range. With sufficiently powerful energy weapons, one might manage to destroy their fleets before they can even get in range."
 EaC_civic_mechanic_events.260.desc:0 "The Unbidden's exclusive reliance on energy gives us an obvious weakness to exploit. Weapons dealing extra damage to their shields should prove devastating, but if you can fit weapons that completely bypass their shields, they won't be long for this dimension. Defensively, you should look at bringing your own shields to the fight to adequately counter their energy beams."
 EaC_civic_mechanic_events.265.desc:0 "Contingency ships exclusively use energy weapons- as such, it is best to use shields to mitigate incoming damage. Simulations indicate that despite having strong defense, their ship's hulls are relatively fragile. Our smugglers estimate that penetrating weapons might perform very well against them."
 EaC_civic_mechanic_events.266.desc: "Cetana's ships rely on long range, high damage energy weapons and sturdy regenerating armor. They are adept at taking down large targets, and you would do well to instead harass them with swarms of smaller crafts. Torpedos or energy weapons should perform adequately against her fleets, and shielding your vessels might help them survive a little longer."
